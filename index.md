Generally we like to say **Statistics** is the science of conducting studies to collect, organize, summarize, analyze and finally draw conclusions from data. There are some basics within the field of statistics, including variable, data, rounding rules and exercises, measurement scale, sampling and sampling errors, experimental design and so on. For instancing, variables are say characteristic to assume values, data are the values that the variables assume, dataset is the collection of data and data value(datum) is each value in the dataset. More, population is the set of all subjects, sample, on the other hand, should be a group of subjects selected from population.

In this article, we will glance at some very fundemental definitions and terms on Statistics.

# 1. Descriptive & Inferential statistics

Descriptive statistics is the science of statiscs to collect, organize and summarize the data, and then present the data in description. In another way, inferential statistics is to generalize from samples to populations, perform estimations, do hypothesis test and determine relationships among variables and conclusively make prediction for the objective. 

# 2. Variables 

Two main branches of classifiying variables, qualitative and quantitative variables. Qualitative variables is the variables that have distinct categories, whereas the quantitative variables which can be counted or measured have two classes, discrete and continuous, continuous variables are infinite number of values between any two specific values, discrete variables are basically a set of numbers which are not infinite.

# 3. Measurement scale

There are four scales of measurement, nominal level, ordinal level, interval level and ratio level. 

Nominal level of meansurement has the mutually exclusive categories in which no order or ranking.

Ordinal level of measurement has the categories that can be ranked.

The interval level, ranking data, has the precise difference between units of measure exist. There is no meaningful zero on this measurement, for example, IQ and temperature.

The ratio level is " the interval level with true zero", for example, height = 0 means that no height.

# 4. Sampling methods

## 4.1 Random sampling

Random sampling is easiest sampling methods within which each member of population have equal chance or probability to be chosen.

## 4.2 Systematic sampling

The procedure of systematic sampling generally say is that **A.** Choose the first point to start the sampling, **B** Select every Kth memeber of the population.

## 4.3 Stratified sampling

For stratified sampling, we need to divide the population into different subgroups by the attributions we assign to, then for each subgroup, select the value(member) randomly.

## 4.4 Cluster sampling

The feature of cluster sampling is that the within-group difference is big but the between-group difference is small. The group we choose is the "miniature population". 

There is a example: in a campus, the researcher wants to study on the body weight of all students, but we can not measure that through "batching", so there is a method that do cluster sampling, we choose the students from every class by a common attribute from each class, which means that we have representative samples from all classes, in other words, the between-group difference is small but within-group difference is big.  

## 4.5 Convenience sampling
